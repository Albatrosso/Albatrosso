### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
My name is Nikita
I am a passionate web developer and love challenging puzzles.

Behind me is about 5 years of developing projects of varying complexity and subject matter. Of these 5 years, I have been in leadership for about three years, and also periodically help various teams as an invited technical consultant

At the moment I work for X5 Retail Group, which is one of the largest organizations in Russia in the retail industry.
Together with other guys from our company, we have created a lot of really cool things. CRM systems for quick response to customer requests, management of numerous outlets throughout the country, several client applications so that each person has the opportunity to quickly get groceries or other products from their favorite supermarket or restaurant, spending no more than five minutes on it


If you want to know more about my experience, then write to me - I prefer Telegram, but I also have an email and LinkedIn profile, but response may take time. All contacts at the end

At the moment I am immersing myself in the architecture of information systems and developing leadership competencies in order to make myself and my colleagues happy every day

I am engaged in mentoring and helping junior colleagues to comprehend the profession of a web developer as much as I can


Interesting facts about me:
- I am fond of history, robotics and artificial intelligence 
- I know how to insert usb devices into the port on the first try 
- I love stupid jokes and puns ðŸ¤¡
